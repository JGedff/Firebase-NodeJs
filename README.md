# Firebase-NodeJs

Hello, this is a web made with NodeJs and express handlebars for its routing.

For now, you just will be able to see the colectins 'posts' and 'coments' in the database firebase.

You'll have to create a .json for de SDK from firebase and leave it in the same folder as .env and in the config.js you'll have to put the https to your firebase.

In the main.hbs you will have to link the CSS and the JavaScript from the folder toFirebaseSotage with the url that firebase gives you.

To install all packages you'll have to use the comand npm run install.
